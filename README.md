## Problem Statement
The objective is to construct a CNN-based model capable of accurately identifying melanoma, a potentially fatal form of cancer that necessitates early detection. Melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related fatalities. An automated system capable of analyzing images and notifying dermatologists about potential melanoma cases holds the potential to significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis. 

### DataSet
The dataset comprises 2,357 images representing both malignant and benign oncological conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images were categorized according to ISIC classifications, with each subset containing an approximately equal number of images, except for melanomas and moles, which have a slight prevalence.

The dataset encompasses the following skin conditions:

* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion
